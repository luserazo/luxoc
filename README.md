## A Compiler Written in Java

Luxoc is a compiler written in Java for a Pascal-like language. The project
was assigned in CMPU-331 (Compiler Design) during the Spring semester of 2018 
at Vassar College. 

### Stable Parts

I've currently implemented both the lexical analyzer and the parser. These have been
tested numerous times and have proven themselves to be stable. 

#### TODO:

Despite implementing the lexer and parser, there's still a lot of work to be done.
In the coming weeks I hope to begin working on the:

- Symbol Table
- Semantic Actions
