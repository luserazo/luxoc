## A Compiler Written in Java

Luxoc is a compiler written in Java for a Pascal-like language. The parse table for the project can be found in: ``src/main/resources``. This implementation uses a **LL(1)** parser. 

### Stable Parts

This project has been completed and can be tested on any one of the files found in: ``src/test/pascal/semantics``. The other tests found in: ``src/test/pascal`` correspond to the various parts of the implementation, such as the Lexical Analyzer. 

#### TODO:

Optimization.
